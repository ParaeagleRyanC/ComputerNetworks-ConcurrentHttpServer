# Concurrent HTTP Server

Concurrent HTTP Server uses [HTTP Server](https://github.com/ParaeagleRyanC/ComputerNetworks-HttpServer/) as its base version. Functionalities remain the same. However, instead of handling one client at a time, it can now handle multiple clients at once.

Three methods are used to implement this concurrent server.
* Thread
* Thread-Pool
* Async

One of the above options can be selected when running the program through the CLI.

This program demonstrates the knowledge of using threading and processes in Python, making an HTTP server concurrent, and familiarity with benchmarking.
